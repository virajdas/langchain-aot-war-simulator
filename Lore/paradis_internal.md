# Paradis Island Strategic Intelligence & Factional Overview  
Codename: New Eldian Empire  
Timeline: Post–Return to Shiganshina, Pre-Liberio Raid (Between Season 3 & 4)

---

## 1. Governance Model

Paradis operates as a semi-militarized republic with a fractured legislative structure. Civil governance exists but functions beneath heavy military institutional influence. Authority is divided between elected civilian leadership and de facto military commanders.

The dissolution of isolationism and exposure of world history triggered ideological fragmentation within governance, eroding public trust in centralized authority structures.

Political stability is undermined by:

- Discovery that Eldians are globally feared “Subjects of Ymir.”
- Public realization that humanity exists beyond Paradis.
- External genocidal threat narratives targeting all Eldians.
- Ethical and legal disputes surrounding Titan deterrence doctrine.
- The absence of recognized international diplomatic status or formal treaties.

---

## 2. Military Factions

### Survey Corps (Scouts)

- Primary mobile reconnaissance unit and offensive Titan engagement force.
- Frontline specialists in anti-Titan warfare using ODM gear.
- Pioneers of experimental anti-Titan weapon systems.
- Ideologically driven by exploration and personal freedom.
- Veterans now undergoing doctrinal transformation toward combined-arms anti-personnel warfare, incorporating modern firearms, explosives, and tactical infantry formations.
- Historically entrusted with Titan inheritance roles among commanding officers.

---

### Garrison Regiment

- Defensive military corps.
- Responsible for fortifications, wall maintenance, urban defense, artillery installations, evacuation logistics, and population protection mandates.
- Operates all major city defense plans and perimeter anti-landing contingencies.
- Functions as the logistical backbone of resettlement operations following the return to Wall Maria.

---

### Military Police (MP)

- National internal security force.
- Charged with maintaining political stability and law enforcement.
- Historically aligned with the pre-coup aristocratic elite and monarchy.
- Organization legitimacy weakened following revelation of elite corruption and complicity in historical suppression efforts.

---

## 3. Political Factions

### Diplomatic Reformists

- Advocate normalization of international relations.
- Seek economic trade access, diplomatic legitimacy, and technological parity through peaceful engagement.
- Maintain ties to Hizuru diplomatic back channels.

---

### Militant Expansionists

- Argue Titan deterrence supremacy is the sole means of survival.
- Promote early activation or escalation toward full Rumbling doctrine.
- Gain traction among war veterans and populations traumatized by existential threat narratives.

---

### Moderates

- Support equilibrium strategies of delay.
- Encourage quiet technological buildup while postponing overt diplomatic engagement.
- Advocate secrecy, limited reconnaissance probing, and defensive military posturing until further geopolitical clarity is achieved.

---

## 4. Intelligence & Espionage Network

Paradis intelligence operations remain in early development but are rapidly expanding due to assistance from defectors and volunteer groups.

### Primary Intelligence Sources

- Marley military defectors and resistance pipelines.
- Maritime reconnaissance and offshore scouting missions.
- POW interrogations and seized communications.
- Wireless interception through newly constructed radio networks.

### Volunteer Support Network

- **Anti-Marleyan Volunteers, led by Yelena**, provide:

  - Advanced technology transfer.
  - Military training consultation.
  - Strategic intelligence regarding Marley, global deployments, and Titan handler coordination.

---

### Intelligence Mission Objectives

- Tracking Marley Warrior movement.
- Monitoring naval fleet expansions.
- Mapping international diplomatic alliances.
- Identifying potential invasion corridors and landing zones.

---

## 5. Titan Strategic Assets

### Founding Titan — Eren Yeager

- Planet-scale biological weapon authority.
- Capable of commanding Titans, executing genetic overrides affecting all Subjects of Ymir, and initiating continental-level Rumbling.
- Deployment restricted by royal blood compatibility requirement — currently operational access remains incomplete without royal contact.

---

### Attack Titan — Eren Yeager

- High-mobility assault Titan.
- Functions as battlefield spearhead.
- Exhibits foresight and temporal memory inheritance.

---

### Colossal Titan — Armin Arlert

- Mass-destruction platform.
- Capable of instantaneous city-level annihilation.
- Effective port or coastal invasion disruption tool.

---

### Secondary Titan Inheritance

- Historically passed among Scout leadership for high-impact operations.
- Provides auxiliary strike, containment, and suppression capabilities when fielded.

---

## 6. Enemy Intelligence: Marley Empire

### Location

- Continental empire across the ocean from Paradis.

---

### Military Capabilities

- Large industrial military complex.
- Advanced naval fleets.
- Early-stage aerial warfare via airships.
- Modern artillery manufacturing.
- Continued reliance on Titan shock warfare doctrine.

---

### Known Warrior Unit Threats

- **Reiner Braun — Armored Titan**
- **Zeke Yeager — Beast Titan**
- **Cart Titan — Marley mobile logistics and artillery platform**

---

### Geopolitical Status

- Marley is engaged in a major continental conflict with the **Mid-East Allied Forces**, reducing outward offensive pressure and providing Paradis with a limited strategic development window.

---

## 7. Current Strategic Objectives

**Primary Objective:** Survival through preparedness and deterrence development.

### Operational Subgoals

1. **Technological Advancement**

   - Rail network construction.
   - Acquisition and development of wireless radio infrastructure.
   - Production of modern firearms.
   - Reverse engineering of Marley artillery.
   - Prototyping of naval vessels.

2. **International Diplomacy**

   - Covert negotiations toward recognition.
   - Exploration of non-Marley allied prospects.

3. **Territorial Hardening**

   - Coastal fortification installations.
   - Anti-landing artillery coordination.
   - Defensive perimeter reinforcement.

4. **Titan Deterrence Maintenance**

   - Contingency planning for Founding Titan activation.
   - Scenario modeling for partial or total Rumbling deployment.

---

## 8. Internal State

### Societal Context

The civilian population now understands:

- Humanity exists beyond the island.
- Eldians are universally feared and classified as monsters.
- All Subjects of Ymir possess the dormant ability to transform into Titans.

This revelation has produced:

- Civil trauma.
- Identity collapse responses.
- Accelerated militarization of society.
- Growing ideological polarization regarding survival doctrine.

---

### Territorial Control

- **Wall Maria reclaimed successfully.**
- Full repopulation efforts underway.
- All Pure Titans neutralized.
- Overland travel restored across the entire island.

---

### Industrial Expansion

Rapid industrial growth underway:

- Railway connectivity between settlements.
- Construction of wireless radio relay chains.
- Operation of munitions factories.
- Shipyard development projects along select coastlines.

Development powered through:

- Hizuru engineering coordination.
- Volunteer supply pipelines.
- Reverse-engineered Marley industrial technologies.

---

## 9. Public Morale

Civilian morale remains strained and suppressed.

Dominant conditions:

- Psychological trauma from isolationism collapse.
- Persistent fear of genocidal extermination narratives abroad.
- Ethical distress surrounding Titan militarization as a survival necessity.

---

## 10. Ethical & Legal Status

No formal constitutional or legislative restrictions exist governing Titan deployment.

All Titan utilization remains under indefinite emergency executive authority.

### Moral Polarization

**Pro-Weaponization Position**
- The Rumbling, as deterrent threat supremacy, guarantees peace through terror stability.

**Anti-Weaponization Position**
- Utilization of genocidal deterrence condemns Eldia morally and perpetuates endless cycles of annihilation.

No viable consensus has emerged.

---

## 11. Strategic Intelligence Summary

Paradis remains in volatile equilibrium:

- Military potential: Extremely high.
- Political cohesion: Fragmented and uncertain.
- Technological parity acquisition: Rapid acceleration.
- Ethical unity: Severely fractured.

**Time remains the decisive variable.**

The continental war temporarily binds Marley’s focus. The splintered state of global geopolitics leaves Paradis with a vanishing window to choose between:

- Diplomatic integration.
- Or overwhelming Titan deterrence escalation before unavoidable global war.
