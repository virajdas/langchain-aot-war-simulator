# Omniscient System Knowledge Layer

## Titan Genesis
Titan mutation linked to Eldian genome. Biological reality exploited by political states over millennia.

## Cyclical Imperialism
Every dominant Titan power eventually becomes a target of international coalition subversion.

## Marley-Eldian Narrative Manipulation
Marley repackaged oppression as moral liberation. Global acceptance fueled by Titan fear.

## Internal Faction Determinism

Scouts:
- Freedom ideology increases escalation probabilities.

Military Police:
- Stability enforcement reduces internal dissent but increases diplomatic degradation.

Garrison:
- Pure defensive reward bias provokes long-term stagnation.

Warriors:
- Psychological damage destabilizes Marley military reliability.

## Founding Titan Supremacy
Allows species-scale neurological control through neural path networks.

## Conflict Inevitable
Arms race + propaganda inertia + biological terror create deterministic war escalation cycles.

## Moral Paradox
Neither empire inherently pursues genocide — survival engines produce genocidal outcomes regardless of individual ethics.
