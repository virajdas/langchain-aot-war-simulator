# Marley Empire Strategic Intelligence & Warrior Operations Overview  
Codename: Marley Public Security & Warrior Unit  
Timeline: Mid-East Alliance Conflict (Between Season 3 & 4)

---

## 1. National Doctrine

Marley’s global strategy centers on the preservation of hegemonic dominance through:

- Titan terror as an asymmetric warfare doctrine.
- Strategic military alliances.
- International narrative engineering to maintain hostility toward Eldians and legitimize Marley’s actions.

Titan supremacy has historically been the primary factor securing Marley’s geopolitical power projection.

---

## 2. Political Structure

Marley’s governing bodies consist of:

- Parliamentary assemblies dominated by military-industrial leadership.
- Token civilian councils that exist nominally but remain subservient to military authorities.

Political power is functionally consolidated in wartime command structures and industrial arms conglomerates sustaining Titan weapons programs.

---

## 3. Eldian Policy

Marley maintains strict racial governance systems regarding Eldians:

- Concentration and confinement within designated internment zones (notably Liberio).
- Titans created from Eldians serve as battlefield expendables and psychological weapons.
- Warrior candidates are indoctrinated child soldiers prized as valuable assets yet treated institutionally as disposable liabilities.

Eldians thus occupy a dual status:
- Militarily indispensable.
- Politically dehumanized.

---

## 4. Military Structure

### Titan Warrior Units

Each Titan weapon fulfills a specialized doctrinal combat niche:

#### Jaw Titan — Porco Galliard  
- Urban breach and precision assassination operations.
- Extreme speed and destructive jaw weaponry.
- Recently reclaimed from the former wielder Ymir.

#### Armored Titan — Reiner Braun  
- Heavy assault battering ram.
- Frontline spearbreak against fortifications.
- Current status: Severe PTSD and psychological destabilization, resulting in eroding ideological loyalty.

#### Cart Titan — Pieck Finger  
- Extended endurance mobile operations.
- Artillery turret and logistics support platform.

#### Beast Titan — Zeke Yeager (War Chief)  
- Long-range devastation specialist via fragmentation throwing abilities.
- Tactical battlefield commander and Titan unit coordination asset.
- Able to induce Eldian Titanization via deployment of spinal fluid.
- **Secret Classification:** Holder of royal blood lineage.

#### Female Titan — Annie Leonhart  
- Tactical adaptability Titan platform.
- Lost asset.
- Current status: **Captured by Paradis forces.**

#### War Hammer Titan — Tybur Family  
- Stored as strategic reserve.
- Combat deployment restricted and politically controlled.
- Combat capabilities remain largely unknown to general Marley military commands and Warrior units.

### Conventional Armed Forces

Marley fields one of the world’s largest non-Titan militaries:

- Estimated ground forces exceeding **1 million soldiers.**
- Massive artillery divisions.
- Naval fleets including specialized Titan transport carriers and battleships.
- Emerging aerial warfare division using zeppelins.
- Experimental air-combat doctrine development underway.

---

## 5. Intelligence & Propaganda Operations

### Intelligence Operations

- Pre-invasion infiltration teams deployed deep into Paradis prior to major assault operations.
- Continuous scouting, internal destabilization, and long-term siege reconnaissance missions.

---

### Diplomatic & Psychological Warfare

- Global misinformation campaigns conducted to preserve hostile sentiment toward Eldians.
- Ongoing narrative construction asserting Eldians as existential threats to humanity.
- Diplomatic pressure on foreign states to prevent fracture of Marley’s alliance coalition.

---

## 6. Political Fears & Strategic Instability

Marley leadership faces mounting concern over:

- Rapid technological advancement among rival nations reducing Titan battlefield superiority.
- Emergence of anti-Titan artillery (particularly within Mid-East Alliance territories).
- Growing domestic and international scrutiny over Eldian exploitation policies.
- Expanding humanitarian pressure that threatens Marley's perceived legitimacy.

---

## 7. Current Strategic Objectives

**Primary Objective:**

Secure the **Founding Titan (The Coordinate)** from Paradis to restore dominant military leverage.

---

### Supporting Goals

- Maintain cohesion of the global coalition supporting Marley’s hegemonic authority.
- Ensure uninterrupted supply acquisition of **Iceburst Stone from Paradis** to fuel technological development and modernization.
- Counteract global arms parity by reasserting Titan deterrence credibility.
- Suppress foreign humanitarian investigations into internment zone practices.

---

## 8. Intelligence Assessment: Enemy – Paradis/Eldia

### Official Designation

**"Island Devils."**

---

### Threat Level

**Extreme.**

Paradis control of the Founding Titan constitutes the highest threat to Marley strategic stability.

---

### Known Paradis Capabilities

- Successful recapture of **Wall Maria.**
- Deployment of elite genetically enhanced soldiers: **Ackermans (Levi Ackerman and Mikasa Ackerman)** who demonstrate combat capability rivalling or exceeding Titan-class threat profiles.
- Significant adaptation toward anti-personnel and modern warfare.

---

### Warrior Unit Losses

- **Female Titan — Annie Leonhart:** Captured.
- **Colossal Titan — Bertholdt Hoover:** Deceased; Titan stolen by Paradis and reassigned to Armin Arlert.

---

## 9. Internal State

### Geopolitical Crisis

- Anti-Titan artillery proliferation within the Mid-East Allied Forces threatens Marley military doctrine sustainability.
- Titan terror is increasingly inadequate against industrialized combined-arms warfare.

---

### Eldian Condition

- Eldians remain segregated within internment ghettos such as Liberio.
- Systematically employed as cannon fodder and transformational weapons platforms.

---

### Propaganda Strategy

- Primary narrative framing presents King Fritz as a world-ending tyrant who threatened humanity with **The Rumbling.**
- This fear mythology justifies international hostility toward Paradis and continued military campaigns under the guise of humanity’s defense.

---

## 10. Strategic Intelligence Summary

Marley is approaching a geopolitical inflection point:

- Titan weapon supremacy is degrading.
- Conventional arms competition is accelerating globally.
- Internal legitimacy erosion continues under humanitarian scrutiny.
- Dependence on recovery of the Founding Titan is absolute.

**Failure to reclaim the Founding Titan risks the permanent collapse of Marley’s hegemonic status.**

The Mid-East conflict absorbs significant Marley resources — temporarily preventing direct invasion pressure on Paradis, but narrowing the operational window to resolve Titan attrition before technological parity renders Titan terror obsolete.
